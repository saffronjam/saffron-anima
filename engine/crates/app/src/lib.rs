//! The run loop and the `Layer` lifecycle — the bare runnable spine of a Saffron
//! Anima host.
//!
//! Provides the [`Layer`] trait (a set of optional lifecycle hooks), the [`App`] /
//! [`AppConfig`] types, and [`run`] — the
//! `poll → on_update → begin_frame → on_render → on_ui → begin_frame_graph →
//! on_render_graph → end_frame` loop with the `SAFFRON_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES` frame
//! limit and the `wait_gpu_idle`-before-teardown ordering.
//!
//! ## Reactive pacing
//!
//! The loop is **reactive**, not free-running. A [`RedrawController`] on [`App`] decides each
//! iteration whether to render or skip: the host sets the per-frame activity in `on_update`
//! (continuous while an animation/physics sim runs or an edit smooths, a one-shot request when a
//! mutating control command lands), and the loop renders at the renderer's `target_fps`
//! ([`FrameHost::pace_target_fps`]) while active, holds a brief keep-warm window after the last
//! activity, then drops to a poll-only idle (the GPU goes quiet, the last published frame stays on
//! screen). A layer-less app and the GPU-free test host default to *continuous* — they render every
//! frame as before.
//!
//! Two modes share one [`run`]: a **windowed** standalone host (a winit window +
//! a surface-bound renderer that presents through a real swapchain) and a
//! **headless** editor host (no window, a feature-selected device), decided from
//! `SAFFRON_EDITOR_NATIVE_VIEWPORT`. They share the per-frame body ([`step_frame`])
//! and the `start` / `finish` bring-up/teardown; only the loop driver differs — a
//! plain `while` ([`drive`]) headless vs a winit [`ApplicationHandler`]
//! ([`run_windowed`]) windowed, since winit 0.30 owns its own loop. There is no shm
//! publish, no overlay, and no control plane here — those belong to `saffron-host`,
//! which is a single [`Layer`] plus the lifecycle closures this loop invokes.
//!
//! ## Why a [`FrameHost`] trait
//!
//! The loop drives `begin_frame`/`end_frame`/`wait_gpu_idle` through the
//! [`FrameHost`] trait so the loop's hook-dispatch order and frame-limit/fps logic
//! are testable without a GPU (the verification gate runs on software llvmpipe, or
//! on no device at all in the unit tests). The real [`saffron_rendering::Renderer`]
//! implements it; the loop holds it as `Box<dyn FrameHost>` so [`App`] stays a
//! concrete type and [`Layer`] stays object-safe (`Box<dyn Layer>`). This is the
//! same "device selection is a parameter, not a fork" principle the renderer's
//! [`SurfaceSource`] follows — one [`run`], the host swapped behind a trait.
//!
//! DAG: depends on `saffron-core`, `saffron-window`, `saffron-rendering`.
