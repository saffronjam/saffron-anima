//! The asset catalog resolves baked sub-assets (a material, a mesh) by an id
//! derived from the model key, the sub-asset kind, the source name, and a
//! duplicate-disambiguation index. The id must be **stable across reimports** so a
//! re-bake of the same source resolves to the same id — a drifting hash silently
//! orphans every baked sub-asset. The hash is FNV-1a over the three string fields with
//! an extra mix round between fields, then a four-byte little-endian mix of
//! `dup_index`, then the `< 1024 -> + 1024` fold into the non-reserved id range.
