//! The GPU-upload seam the resolve/load paths reach through.
//!
//! Rendering owns the upload calls (README §1); this crate reaches them through the
//! [`GpuUploader`] trait so the loaders are one code path over either the live renderer
//! or a test stub — the upload is genuinely performed by rendering's ash seam, not
//! stubbed in the engine.
//!
//! The trait carries exactly the three upload entry points the loaders need plus the
//! `skinning_enabled` gate `render_scene` reads (the skinned draw path is byte-identical
//! to a build without it when off). Errors surface as [`saffron_rendering::Error`]; the
//! loaders turn a failure into a logged warn plus a negative-cache `None`, never an `Err`.
