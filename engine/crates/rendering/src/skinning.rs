//! The compute skinning pre-pass apparatus.
//!
//! [`Skinning`] owns, per frame-in-flight, a deformed-vertex buffer (base 32-byte
//! [`saffron_geometry::Vertex`] layout, `STORAGE|VERTEX`, grow-only) that every skinned
//! mesh-instance deforms into, plus a parallel prev-deformed buffer the motion pass reads
//! as the prev-position stream. The `skin` compute PSO deforms once per vertex; every
//! geometry pass then reads the result as an ordinary static vertex stream — the
//! deform-once win. The per-instance descriptor sets are allocated from a per-frame pool
//! that is reset wholesale each frame.
//!
//! It also owns the cross-frame motion caches keyed by entity uuid: last frame's palette
//! slice (deformation motion) + last frame's world matrix (object motion). A new entity
//! reads back current == previous, so its first frame emits zero motion (no velocity
//! flash). These are single-threaded host state mutated through [`Skinning`]'s methods.
//!
//! The joint + prev-joint palettes live in [`crate::Instancing`] (set 2, binding 1).
