//! The render graph: `RgUsage`-declared resource usage, derived barriers, and
//! recorded pass order — the silent-failure heart of the renderer.
//!
//! A pass *declares* what it touches ([`RgUsage`] reads/writes plus color/depth
//! attachments) and the graph derives every `vkCmdPipelineBarrier2`, every layout
//! transition, and the cross-frame layout write-back. No pass ever writes a
//! barrier by hand.
//!
//! The barrier derivation is pure logic on plain data, split out from the GPU
//! recording so it is unit-testable with no device — a missing or wrong barrier
//! is a data race, not a compile error, so the derivation is the part that must be
//! exhaustively tested in isolation.
