//! The shm-ABI go/no-go gate.
//!
//! Proves the frozen frame transport: the producer publishes BGRA8 frames that the editor
//! reader `editor/src-tauri/src/wayland_viewport.rs` accepts byte-for-byte. The acceptance is
//! byte-level agreement with the *actual* reader's read / accept / reject rules, so this test
//! embeds an oracle reader ([`OracleReader`]) that replicates `step_view` / `open_shm` /
//! `stat_shm` field-for-field (the same header words, the same magic + capacity + ring-fits
//! checks, the same `seq % slots` slot index, the same `buffer_dims` rebuild trigger) and
//! consumes the producer's segment exactly as the editor would.
//!
//! The gate runs the host's [`ViewportShmPublisher`] (the same wiring the run loop drives),
//! publishes N frames sized by `set-viewport-size`, and asserts the oracle:
//!   * accepts every published frame (magic matches, `pixel_bytes <= capacity`, the ring
//!     fits `total`),
//!   * reads consistent width/height + pixels after the `seq` advances (no torn frame),
//!   * sees `seq` monotonic over N frames with slot = `seq % 4`, and the first frame in
//!     slot 1 (the `next = seq + 1` off-by-one the reader mirrors),
//!   * tracks the displayed dimensions to the rendered size.
//!
//! Both view segments exist from startup (the presenter's blocking open would otherwise
//! stall): the asset-preview segment is present with `seq 0` even when only the scene view
//! renders, found by the same read-only `shm_open` probe `stat_shm` uses.
//!
//! This gate covers the byte-exact ABI match against the reader oracle. The full live present
//! (the editor displaying the frame on a Wayland subsurface) needs the GTK/WebKit/Wayland
//! editor stack, which does not run headless in the toolbox, so it is not covered here.
//!
//! `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` covers the `unsafe { set_var }` the env-contract sub-test needs to
//! reproduce the editor's `SAFFRON_VIEWPORT_SHM_*` startup contract; the mutation is serialized
//! by `ENV_LOCK` so no other thread reads the vars concurrently.
