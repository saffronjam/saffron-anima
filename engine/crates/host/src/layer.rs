//! The [`HostLayer`] apex: the single [`Layer`] that owns the editor session and wires
//! every subsystem into the run loop.
//!
//! The host state lives as plain fields on this layer: the run loop owns the layer, the
//! layer owns its state, and the lifecycle is methods on it — single-threaded throughout.
//!
//! The per-frame work splits cleanly in two:
//!
//! - The **session update** ([`HostLayer::update_session`]) is the renderer-independent
//!   spine: the parent-death watch, the asset-preview prune, `tick_animation` →
//!   `tick_play`, the deferred script-error pause, and the fly-camera drain. It runs on
//!   pure CPU state, so the unit tests drive it with no GPU.
//! - The **renderer-coupled** work (the control poll, the gizmo-drag smoothing that reads
//!   the viewport size, and the whole `on_ui` scene render + overlay submit) reaches the
//!   concrete [`Renderer`] through [`saffron_app::FrameHost::renderer_mut`]; with no
//!   renderer attached (the test host) those steps are skipped.
