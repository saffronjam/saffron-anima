//! Host-side wiring of the viewport shm publisher.
//!
//! Ports `host.cppm:1043-1052`: the editor sets a per-view shm-segment environment
//! variable (`SAFFRON_VIEWPORT_SHM_SCENE` / `SAFFRON_VIEWPORT_SHM_ASSET`); each named
//! view publishes its rendered frames into its own POSIX-shm segment for the
//! compositor-side presenter (`wayland_viewport.rs`) instead of presenting to the hidden
//! swapchain. Both segments are created at startup so both panes have a ring the
//! presenter can block-open; only the active view bumps a new sequence each frame.
//!
//! The byte-exact producer is [`saffron_rendering::ShmPublish`] (the mmap + seqlock +
//! release fence). This module owns only the *selection*: which views to enable, under
//! which segment names, from the environment — the pure decision the C++ host made
//! inline. The view tokens are the FROZEN wire strings the reader's `View::from_wire`
//! expects (`"scene"` / `"assetPreview"`), kept identical end-to-end.
