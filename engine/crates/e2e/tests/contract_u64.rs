//! The decimal-string-u64 contract probe against the live Rust engine: drive id-returning
//! commands and assert their raw reply bytes carry every id as a quoted decimal string, the same
//! invariant the canonical TS gate (`tools/check-control-schema/check.ts:assertRawU64`) enforces.
//!
//! This is the engine-side peer of that gate (phase 6): the TS check stays canonical (it also
//! proves the editor's JSON path), but a Cargo-native mirror lets the engine crew catch a `Uuid`
//! regression without leaving `cargo test`. The negative probe (a bare-number id is *caught*) lives
//! as a unit test in `src/lib.rs`; this file proves the positive direction live.
