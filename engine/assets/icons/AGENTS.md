# Editor icons

SVGs vendored from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/). `cargo run -p xtask -- shaders` copies the
whole `icons/` directory next to the host binary on every build (alongside `models/` and `fonts/`,
via `copy_asset_tree` in `engine/xtask/src/shaders.rs`), but **nothing currently consumes them**.
The Tauri/React editor ships its own icons via the `lucide-react` package, and the host's
in-viewport billboards are native flat-colored glyphs built as overlay geometry
(`build_scene_edit_billboards` in `engine/crates/host/src/overlay.rs`) — no textures, and the
renderer has no SVG-icon upload path.

Treat this directory as vestigial — leave it unless you are reviving textured icons or cleaning up
the asset copy.

## Adding a new icon (if reviving)

```sh
# From the repo root:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucide-icons/lucide/main/icons/<name>.svg \
     -o engine/assets/icons/<name>.svg
```

Browse names at https://lucide.dev/icons/ — the URL slug is the filename without `.svg`.
