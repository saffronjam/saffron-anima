# Phase 18 — Slang codegen backend

**Status:** NOT STARTED
**Depends on:** 01, 17

## Goal

The real node-graph backend: lower a material graph to a Slang **`evalSurface`** body, compile it with
`slangc`, and load the result as a per-material PSO — **linked against the shared lighting compiled once as
a Slang module**. Async compile with a fallback material while building; PSO cache keyed by graph hash.
This is what makes triplanar/noise/custom math possible (phase 19's nodes), and it does **not** touch the
lighting code — the seam from phase 01 is the entire integration surface.

## Why

A params-only graph (phase 17) can't do procedural surface math. Codegen of `evalSurface` is the UE
material model done right for this engine: one PSO per unique graph (× static/skinned × passes), lighting
shared, so PSO count stays linear in material count. Slang's interfaces/generics/separate-compilation are
why touching lighting won't recompile every material (the trap UE hit with HLSL stitching).

## Design

- **Lowering**: topologically sort the graph; emit a Slang snippet per node (phase 19 supplies the snippets)
  into a generated `evalSurface(MaterialInput) -> SurfaceData` body; uniform inputs (constants, texture
  indices) come from the `MaterialParams` buffer (so editing a constant is a buffer write, **not** a recompile —
  only graph *topology* changes trigger compile).
- **Module linking**: compile the shared lighting (the phase-01 `fragmentMain` lighting half + BRDF + IBL +
  GI) **once** as a Slang module exposing `evalLighting(SurfaceData, …)`. Each material compiles only its
  generated `evalSurface` + the thin entry point, linking the lighting module. `slangc` separate compilation /
  link-time specialization makes this incremental.
- **Invocation**: the host shells out to `slangc` (the toolbox has it) or embeds the Slang API. Editor-only:
  async on a worker, with status (compiling/ok/error) surfaced over the control plane; show the fallback
  material (default/last-good) while compiling; report compile errors to the editor (node-attributed if possible).
- **PSO cache**: key = graph content hash (+ skinned + pass). Extend `requestMeshPipeline`'s string key with
  the graph hash; cache the compiled SPIR-V on disk under the project so re-opens are instant.

## Files to touch

- `engine/assets/shaders/` — split `mesh.slang` so the lighting half is a reusable Slang module; the
  generated material shader `import`s it and supplies `evalSurface`.
- `engine/source/saffron/` (a new `Saffron.MaterialCompiler` area, or under host/rendering) — graph→Slang
  emitter, `slangc` invocation, async compile queue, compiled-SPIR-V cache, compile-status reporting.
- `engine/source/saffron/rendering/renderer_pipelines.cpp` — graph-hash in the PSO cache key; load the
  generated SPIR-V; fallback pipeline while compiling.
- `engine/source/saffron/control/` — `material.compileStatus` / push compile errors to the editor.

## Steps

1. Refactor `mesh.slang` into `lighting` (module) + a thin entry that calls `evalSurface`+`evalLighting`;
   verify identical output (a regression vs phase 01).
2. Build the graph→Slang emitter for a minimal node set (texture, constant, multiply, material output);
   compile via `slangc`; load the SPIR-V; render a sphere.
3. Async compile + fallback-while-building + error reporting; on-disk SPIR-V cache keyed by graph hash.
4. PSO cache key extension; verify N graphs → N PSOs (not combinatorial), lighting compiled once.
5. e2e: a procedural graph (e.g. checker via math nodes) compiles and renders; editing a constant does
   **not** recompile (buffer write); editing topology does.

## Gate / done

- `make engine` clean; the refactored `mesh.slang` renders identically; a codegen graph compiles + renders.
- Constant edits = no recompile; topology edits recompile async with a visible fallback.
- `make prepare-for-commit` clean. Docs: the codegen pipeline + the param-vs-topology cost model.

## Risks

- **"Recompile the world"**: if the lighting isn't a properly linked module, every material recompiles when
  lighting changes. Get Slang module/`import` linking right — this is the make-or-break of the whole endgame.
- **Compile latency / UX**: shelling `slangc` per edit is slow if naive; debounce on topology change only,
  cache aggressively, keep the fallback visible. Never block the present loop on a compile.
- **Runtime compiler footprint**: this is **editor-only**. Shipped builds must not need `slangc` — phase 21
  bakes SPIR-V at cook time. Keep the runtime-compile path behind an editor flag.
- **Error attribution**: map `slangc` errors back to nodes where feasible; at minimum surface the message.
