# Asset store & connectors

The editor's **Store** tab is not a hosted marketplace. It is a thin client over external
asset services that already publish CC0 / Creative-Commons content — Poly Haven first, with
more behind the same interface. Each service is a **connector**; a search runs across every
connector the project has enabled, and importing a result hands the downloaded file to the
engine's existing importer. A solo open-source project cannot run payments, hosting, or
moderation, so it builds none of that — only the search-and-import client.

The connectors live editor-side, in the Tauri bridge (`editor/src-tauri`), so service calls
never hit browser CORS, credentials never reach the renderer, and provider thumbnails render
straight from their URLs. Only the import crosses to the host, over the control plane.

| `connector-framework` | the `StoreConnector` trait, the normalized `StoreResult`, per-source-cursor round-robin search, credentials + per-project enablement, and the download → `import-model` path | `editor/src-tauri/src/connectors/` · `StoreConnector`, `SearchSession` |
| `oauth-and-sketchfab` | the reusable OAuth loopback capability (implicit flow, fragment-bridge page, CSRF state) and the Sketchfab connector + attribution credits | `editor/src-tauri/src/connectors/oauth_loopback.rs` · `run_loopback_login` |
