# Asset commands

The asset commands are the control-plane verbs that manage a project's assets: importing models and
textures, browsing and organizing the catalog, binding assets onto entities, and saving or loading the
project. They act on both the `AssetServer` — the catalog and its GPU caches — and the scene. The
`screenshot` and `quit` commands sit alongside them to complete a scriptable session.

## Import and catalog

| Command | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `import-model` | `{path}` | Imports + bakes a model into the catalog as a `.smodel` container. Returns the model `{id, name, …}`. |
| `instantiate-model` | `{asset, name?}` | Spawns an entity from a catalog model (selected). Returns `{id, name}`. |
| `import-texture` | `{path}` | Imports an image into the asset dir; returns `{texture: id}` to assign later. |
| `list-assets` | — | Returns every catalog entry as `{id, name, type, path, folder?}` plus `folders`. |
| `scan-assets` | — | Rescans the `assets/` dir and reconciles the catalog from disk. |
| `rename-asset` | `{asset, name}` | Renames a catalog entry (selected by id or current name). |
| `create-asset-folder` | `{folder}` | Creates a project-saved virtual folder. |
| `rename-asset-folder` | `{folder, name}` | Renames a virtual folder and updates assets assigned to it. |
| `delete-asset-folder` | `{folder}` | Deletes a virtual folder and moves assigned assets back to root. |
| `move-asset` | `{asset, folder?}` | Moves an asset into a virtual folder, or back to root when `folder` is omitted. |
| `asset-usages` | `{asset}` | Lists scene/environment slots that reference an asset. |
| `delete-asset` | `{asset}` | Deletes the catalog entry and imported file, clears usages, and returns what was cleared. |
| `assign-asset` | `{entity, slot, asset}` | Sets one of the entity's material/mesh slots to a catalog asset. |

`import-model` bakes the source into a `.smodel` container in the catalog; `instantiate-model` is the
command that spawns — it resolves the catalog model and creates a selected entity carrying it.
`import-texture` adds to the catalog alone; the result is attached later with `assign-asset` or
`set-material --albedoTexture`. `assign-asset` takes `slot` (one of `mesh`, `albedo`,
`metallicRoughness`, `normal`, `occlusion`, `emissive`, `height`), resolves the asset by id or name,
adds the target component if the entity lacks it, and writes the asset id into the slot.

Folders are catalog metadata, not filesystem directories. They are saved next to the asset list so
empty folders survive a reload. Renaming a folder updates the folder list and each catalog entry
assigned to the old name. Deleting a folder only removes that virtual folder; assigned assets move
back to root. `delete-asset` clears the scene references (mesh, material textures, sky texture) before
removing the entry and cache records.

## Thumbnails and previews

| Command | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `get-thumbnail` | `{asset, size=128}` | Renders a small preview of a catalog asset; returns the PNG as base64. |
| `view-asset` | `{asset, size=512}` | Same as `get-thumbnail` at a larger default size, for a full-asset look. |
| `thumbnail-cache` | `{action: stats\|clear}` | Inspects (`{entries, bytes}`) or empties the project's thumbnail disk cache. |

Both resolve the `asset` by id or name and return `{format: "png", width, height, base64, pending}`:
the encoded image bytes inline in the JSON result, so a remote UI can show a preview without sharing a
filesystem. The asset's type selects the path. A **mesh** is drawn as a framed 3D render through the
renderer's `render_mesh_thumbnail`, the same preview the Assets panel tiles use. A **texture** is the
image itself, GPU-downscaled to fit the requested size before being read back, so the cost is bounded
by `size`, not the source resolution; an HDR texture is tonemapped on the way out. The command reaches
the renderer through the `ControlRenderer::with_thumbnail_gpu` seam, which hands a transient
`ThumbnailGpu` to `request_thumbnail`.

A generated PNG is written to a persistent **disk cache** at `<projectRoot>/cache/thumbnails/`, keyed
on the asset uuid, the requested size, and a stamp of the source. A hit reads the PNG straight off
disk — no GPU work — so a warm start is disk reads, not regeneration. Edits self-invalidate through
the stamp; `delete-asset` purges an asset's cached PNGs, and `thumbnail-cache clear` empties the dir on
demand.

A cold miss does the real work — decode, upload, render, readback — on the asset crate's
**thumbnail worker thread**, not the per-frame control drain, since a 4k HDR is ~1 s of it. The
command enqueues a job and replies `pending: true` immediately; the worker writes the PNG to the disk
cache and the client retries (with backoff) until the retry is a cache hit. Uploaded textures/meshes
are handed back to the main thread and folded into the in-session caches. The worker is the asset
crate's sole cross-thread site.

## Save and load

| Command | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `save-scene` | `{path}` | Writes the scene (entities + components) to `path`. |
| `load-scene` | `{path}` | Reads a scene file; clears selection. |
| `save-project` | `{path?}` | Writes the asset catalog + scene + render settings for the active project. |
| `load-project` | `{path?}` | Reads catalog + scene; clears selection. |
| `open-project` | `{path}` | Opens a project by path. |
| `new-project` | `{name}` | Creates a fresh project. |

The project commands hold the catalog and scene together, which is what `load-project` needs so that
mesh and texture UUIDs in the scene resolve against the catalog it just loaded. A project load idles
the GPU and clears the thumbnail-worker queue before swapping the caches, so dropping a cached GPU
resource never frees one a frame still reads.

## Session control

| Command | Params | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `screenshot` | `{target: viewport\|window, path}` | Writes a PNG. `viewport` is captured immediately; `window` is deferred to end-of-frame. |
| `quit` | — | Sets the window's should-close flag, ending the run loop. |

`screenshot` reports `pending`: `false` for a viewport grab, done synchronously, and `true` for a
window grab, written when the current frame presents. The [capture](../screenshots-and-capture/) path
has its own page.
