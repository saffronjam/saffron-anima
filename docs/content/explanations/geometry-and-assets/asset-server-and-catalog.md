# Asset catalog

An asset catalog is a named registry that maps stable UUIDs to files on disk, decoupling
the assets a project references from where those files live. Components reference an asset
by `Uuid`; the catalog resolves that id to a name, a type, and a relative path.

The catalog gives every asset an identity that survives renaming and moving its file. A
scene stores a `Uuid` rather than a path, so editing the asset's location or display name
never breaks the reference. Around the catalog sits the asset server, which turns a `Uuid`
into a live GPU resource.

## The server

`AssetServer` is the project's single owner of assets: the catalog plus three UUID-keyed
GPU caches, so entities sharing an asset upload it once.

```rust
pub struct AssetServer {
    pub root: PathBuf,
    pub catalog: AssetCatalog,            // id -> {name, type, path, ...}
    pub mesh_by_uuid: AssetCache<GpuMesh>,        // GPU cache
    pub texture_by_uuid: AssetCache<GpuTexture>,  // GPU cache
    pub model_by_uuid: AssetCache<ModelAsset>,    // opened .smodel containers
    // editor-camera gizmo visual + the optional thumbnail worker
}
```

The catalog is the source of truth; the three maps are caches over it. The catalog records
that asset 42 is a model at `models/42.smodel`; a cache records that 42 is already uploaded
and holds its `Arc`. `AssetServer::new` creates the asset root with its `models/`,
`textures/`, and `materials/` subdirectories. The catalog is normally populated by
[loading a project](../project-serialization/) or a scan.

## The catalog

The catalog is a named registry, not a filesystem view. Each entry pairs a human-facing name
the user can rename with a separate on-disk path:

```rust
pub enum AssetType { Mesh, Texture, Other, Animation, Material, Model }

pub struct AssetEntry {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub name: String,        // UTF-8, renameable, user-facing
    pub asset_type: AssetType,
    pub path: String,        // relative to the asset root
    pub container: Uuid,     // 0 = standalone; else the owning .smodel
    pub chunk: i32,          // TOC chunk index inside the container (-1 = standalone)
    pub colorspace: Colorspace,
    // + folder, hdr/linear flags, animation duration/tracks, rigged
}

pub struct AssetCatalog {
    pub entries: Vec<AssetEntry>,
    pub by_id: HashMap<u64, usize>,  // id -> index into entries
}
```

`AssetCatalog::put` inserts or replaces by id and keeps `by_id` in sync; `find` resolves an
id to an `Option<&AssetEntry>`; `rename` renames in place; `unique_name` appends ` (2)`,
` (3)`, … so two imports of `cube.gltf` get distinct names. `AssetCatalog` lives in
`saffron-scene`, not `saffron-assets`, so the inspector can read it without depending on the
renderer; the asset layer hands the scene a shared read-only handle (`Option<Arc<AssetCatalog>>`).

`AssetEntry` carries container linkage — `container` (the owning [`.smodel`](../smodel-container/))
and `chunk` — so one row can be the model and another a mesh/material/texture embedded inside
it, resolved by `(container, sub-id)`. `colorspace` records how a texture's bytes are
interpreted, recovered from a chunk flag or a `.smeta`.

## The filesystem is the source of truth

The catalog is **derived from a scan**, not authored in `project.json`. `scan_assets` walks
`assets/`, prefix-reads every `.smodel` into a `Model` row plus a row per sub-asset, and
identifies engine-written standalone files by their uuid filename. A foreign file with no
identity in its bytes (a raw `.png` dropped in) gets a `.smeta` sidecar holding its id and
colorspace, minted on first sight. `load_project` reconciles the loaded catalog against the
scan, so an import you never saved is rediscovered rather than orphaned. `load_catalog` is the
fast path: `assets/.cache/catalog.json` memoizes the scan keyed by a signature of the tree.
It is a latency shortcut only — delete it and a cold scan rebuilds an identical catalog.

## Resolving an id to a GPU resource

`load_mesh_asset` and `load_texture_asset` are the resolve-on-demand front doors. Both share
one code path through `resolve_cached`: check the cache; on an absent key, look the id up in
the catalog, load and upload the file, and cache the outcome.

```rust
// resolve_cached(cache, id.value(), || { ... look up + load + upload ... })
//  - a present key returns its cached Option<Arc<T>> verbatim (a live Arc or a cached None)
//  - an absent key runs the loader once and caches its result
```

The cache means many entities referencing the same mesh trigger one load and one
[upload](../gpu-mesh-upload/); the rest are map hits. `render_scene` calls these resolvers
once per entity per frame, so the caching keeps that cheap. `resolve_mesh` / `resolve_texture`
are the cache-only lookups the draw loop uses when the upload has already happened.

## Negative caching

A GPU cache is an `AssetCache<T> = HashMap<u64, Option<Arc<T>>>`, and the inner `Option` is
load-bearing: a **present** key holding `None` is a *negative-cache marker* — a load that
failed and is not retried — distinct from an **absent** key that was never attempted.
`resolve_cached` is the single place that honors this:

```rust
if let Some(cached) = cache.get(&key) {
    return cached.clone();   // a present None is returned verbatim, not retried
}
```

On the next frame the lookup hits that cached `None` and returns it immediately, without
re-reading the broken file or re-warning. Because `render_scene` runs every frame, this keeps
a missing or corrupt asset from flooding the log and re-hitting the disk many times a second.
