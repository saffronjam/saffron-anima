# Vertex layout

Every importer converts into one CPU-side type, `Mesh`, and every vertex is the same
32-byte struct. Fixing both up front lets a single mesh pipeline, a single `.smesh`
on-disk stride, and a single upload path serve glTF and OBJ alike.

## The vertex

A vertex is position, normal, and one UV channel, nothing more:

```cpp
struct Vertex
{
    glm::vec3 position{ 0.0f };
    glm::vec3 normal{ 0.0f };
    glm::vec2 uv0{ 0.0f };
};
static_assert(sizeof(Vertex) == 32, "Vertex must stay 32 bytes (the .smesh on-disk stride)");
```

The `static_assert` is load-bearing. The [`.smesh` format](../smesh-format/) writes the
vertex array as a raw byte blob and the loader reads it straight back, so the in-memory
stride is the disk stride. Adding a member without bumping the format version would
silently misalign every baked mesh on disk.

Tangents are deliberately absent (deferred to material time). Normal-mapped PBR will need
a tangent basis, but that is a later phase, and adding it now would widen the stride for
geometry that does not use it.

## Mesh and submeshes

A `Mesh` is three flat vectors: one shared vertex buffer, one shared index buffer, and a
list of `Submesh` ranges over them.

```cpp
struct Mesh
{
    std::vector<Vertex> vertices;
    std::vector<u32> indices;
    std::vector<Submesh> submeshes;
};
```

A `Submesh` is one `drawIndexed` call's worth of arguments:

```cpp
struct Submesh
{
    u32 firstIndex = 0;
    u32 indexCount = 0;
    i32 vertexOffset = 0;   // signed, matching vkCmdDrawIndexed
    u32 materialSlot = 0;   // reserved (0) until per-submesh materials
};
static_assert(sizeof(Submesh) == 16, "Submesh must stay 16 bytes (baked directly into .smesh)");
```

`vertexOffset` is signed because that is the type `vkCmdDrawIndexed` takes. The glTF
importer sets it per primitive so each primitive's indices stay zero-based against its own
vertex block; the OBJ importer leaves it at 0 and emits indices already relative to the
shared array. Indices are 32-bit throughout, and the loader rejects any file whose
`indexWidth` is not `sizeof(u32)`.

## Why submeshes

Submeshes let one logical model carry several draw ranges over shared buffers. The draw
path loops every batch's `mesh->submeshes` and issues one `drawIndexed` per submesh, so a
model with three glTF primitives becomes three draw calls against one bound buffer pair.

A submesh does not select a material. `materialSlot` is reserved at 0 and the draw path
ignores it; material comes from the per-entity
[`MaterialComponent`](../../scene-and-ecs/built-in-components/), applied to the whole mesh.

## In the code

| What | File | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Vertex + stride assert | `geometry.cppm` | `Vertex` |
| Mesh + submesh | `geometry.cppm` | `Mesh`, `Submesh` |
| Normal regeneration | `geometry.cppm` | `generateNormals` |
| GPU side | `renderer_types.cppm` | `GpuMesh` |
| Per-submesh draw loop | `renderer_drawlist.cpp` | `recordSceneDrawList` |

> [!NOTE]
> `materialSlot` is reserved but not wired anywhere. Both importers write
> `materialSlot = 0`, and the draw path keys material off the entity's `MaterialComponent`,
> not the submesh. Multi-material meshes are a data-model seam, not a working feature. See
> the [import](../gltf-and-obj-import/) and [draw-list](../draw-list/) pages for where it
> stops.
