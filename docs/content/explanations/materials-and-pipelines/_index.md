# Materials & pipelines

A material is the surface description a mesh draws with — its shader and its parameters — and a pipeline is the compiled GPU state that renders it. Materials are first-class, editable assets (`.smat`), assignable to entities and authorable in a node graph. These pages explain how a material resolves to a pipeline and how the pipeline count stays small through four mechanisms:

- One übershader covers every material.
- A specialization constant adds the unlit variant.
- A single bindless texture array lets draws that differ only by texture batch together.
- A node graph folds to params where it can, and only codegens a per-graph shader when it must.
