# Overview

A one-read map of the whole engine. The [explanation pages](../explanations/) expand each
topic; follow the links for the full account.

## Shape of a program

A client — the editor or a standalone app — fills an `AppConfig` and calls `run`,
which owns the window, renderer, UI, and main loop. Clients extend it by attaching
**layers**. A `Layer` is a trait of optional callbacks: implement only the hooks you need.

```rust
let config = AppConfig { window, on_create, on_exit };
return run(config);
```

See [the main loop](../explanations/app-lifecycle-and-window/main-loop-and-run/).

## One frame

`run` drives this sequence every frame. The back half does the substantive work: layers
record GPU work and add render-graph passes, then the renderer derives the barriers and
executes the frame.

```mermaid

    A[poll_events] --> B[layer.on_update dt]
    B --> C{begin_frame ok?}
    C -- no, minimized/resize --> A
    C -- yes --> D[layer.on_render — submit GPU work]
    D --> E[layer.on_ui]
    E --> F[begin_frame_graph — cull + scene passes]
    F --> G[layer.on_render_graph — app adds passes]
    G --> H[end_frame — derive barriers, execute graph, present]
    H --> A
```

When the loop ends, `run` calls `wait_gpu_idle` before any teardown, so no in-flight
command buffer still references a resource about to be freed. That ordering anchors the
engine's [resource ownership model](../explanations/core-and-conventions/).

## Render graph

Each pass **declares** what it does with each resource (`ColorWrite`, `SampledRead`,
`StorageImageRwCompute`, …) rather than writing barriers by hand. The graph turns those
declarations into the right image and memory barriers and layout transitions, then
records each pass body inside its rendering scope.

Light culling, the scene pass, shadow passes, post-processing, and the present blit to the
swapchain are all declared passes over imported images. Start at the
[render graph overview](../explanations/frame-and-render-graph/render-graph-overview/).

## Crates

The engine is a Cargo workspace in `engine/`, a DAG of crates: leaves at the bottom,
the host at the top. Each `saffron-<area>` crate owns one subsystem.

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    core["saffron-core"]
    signal["saffron-signal"] --> core
    json["saffron-json"] --> core
    window["saffron-window"] --> core
    window --> signal
    geometry["saffron-geometry"] --> core
    scene["saffron-scene"] --> core
    scene --> json
    rendering["saffron-rendering"] --> core
    rendering --> window
    rendering --> geometry
    assets["saffron-assets"] --> rendering
    assets --> scene
    assets --> geometry
    sceneedit["saffron-sceneedit"] --> scene
    sceneedit --> signal
    control["saffron-control"] --> sceneedit
    control --> rendering
    control --> assets
    app["saffron-app"] --> rendering
    app --> window
    host["saffron-host"] --> app
    host --> control
    host --> sceneedit
```

`saffron-rendering` carries the render graph; the larger crates split their subsystem
across several modules behind one crate boundary. The
[architecture section](../explanations/architecture-and-conventions/) covers the crate
layout and the build.
