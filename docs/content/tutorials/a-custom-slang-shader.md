# Custom Slang shader

This tutorial writes a new Slang shader, lets the `xtask` shader pipeline compile it to SPIR-V,
and draws scene meshes with it through the renderer's PSO cache. The shader matches the engine's
mesh I/O contract, so it slots into the existing scene pass. Changing the fragment math changes
how every mesh using that material looks.

## How shaders get compiled

The `xtask shaders` task scans every `*.slang` under `engine/assets/shaders/` and compiles each
to `<name>.spv` next to the host binary, under `engine/target/<profile>/shaders/`:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- shaders
```

Per entry-point shader it runs:

```
slangc <shader>.slang -profile glsl_450 -target spirv -emit-spirv-directly \
        -fvk-use-entrypoint-name -matrix-layout-column-major -I <shader_dir> -o <shader>.spv
```

The shared `lighting.slang` is precompiled once to `lighting.slang-module` (`slangc … -emit-ir`,
no `.spv`); every other shader `import lighting` against it. Adding a `.slang` to the folder
compiles it with no code edit — the next pipeline run picks it up, and `just engine` runs the
pipeline right after the Cargo build, so a plain build sees it too. Both entry points live in
one `.slang` module, named by their `[shader(...)]` tag.

## Write the shader

A shader the scene pass can draw with honors the contract `mesh.slang` defines. The vertex
stage consumes the interleaved vertex buffer (`position`/`normal`/`uv0`), reads per-instance
data from the storage buffer on set 2 indexed by `SV_VulkanInstanceID`, and takes the camera
`viewProj` as a push constant. The fragment stage returns `SV_Target`.

Create `engine/assets/shaders/flat.slang`:

```hlsl
// Draws each instance in its base color, lit by one hard-coded headlight.
// Matches mesh.slang's vertex inputs, set 2 (instances), and the camera push
// constant so the scene pass can draw with it unchanged.

struct VertexInput
{
    [[vk::location(0)]] float3 position;
    [[vk::location(1)]] float3 normal;
    [[vk::location(2)]] float2 uv0;
};

struct VertexOutput
{
    float4 position : SV_Position;
    float3 worldNormal : NORMAL;
    float4 baseColor : COLOR0;
};

struct Camera { float4x4 viewProj; };
[[vk::push_constant]] Camera camera;

struct Instance
{
    float4x4 model;
    float4x4 normalMatrix;
    float4 baseColor;
    uint4 texture;
    float4 pbr;
    float4 emissive;
};
[[vk::binding(0, 2)]] StructuredBuffer<Instance> instances;

[shader("vertex")]
VertexOutput vertexMain(VertexInput input, uint instanceIndex : SV_VulkanInstanceID)
{
    Instance inst = instances[instanceIndex];
    VertexOutput output;
    float4 worldPos = mul(inst.model, float4(input.position, 1.0));
    output.position = mul(camera.viewProj, worldPos);
    output.worldNormal = mul((float3x3)inst.normalMatrix, input.normal);
    output.baseColor = inst.baseColor;
    return output;
}

[shader("fragment")]
float4 fragmentMain(VertexOutput input) : SV_Target
{
    float3 n = normalize(input.worldNormal);
    float ndotl = saturate(dot(n, normalize(float3(0.3, 0.6, 1.0))));
    float3 shade = input.baseColor.rgb * (0.2 + 0.8 * ndotl);
    return float4(shade, input.baseColor.a);
}
```

The `Instance` struct must keep the same field order and layout as `mesh.slang`'s: the
renderer fills that storage buffer from its `DrawItem` instances regardless of which shader
draws them. Unused fields can be ignored (here: texture, pbr, emissive), but the order is
fixed.

> [!NOTE]
> The entry points must be named `vertexMain` and `fragmentMain` — that's what
> `build_mesh_pipeline` looks up when it builds the stage create-infos
> (`engine/crates/rendering/src/pipelines.rs`). The vertex input layout (3 attributes) and
> set 2 (instances) are baked into that pipeline layout.

## Build it

Run the shader pipeline so the new `.slang` compiles, then confirm the SPIR-V landed:

```sh
cargo run -p xtask -- shaders          # scans flat.slang, compiles it
ls engine/target/debug/shaders/flat.spv
```

If `slangc` rejects the file, the run fails with the line and message. The `.spv` under
`engine/target/debug/shaders/` is what the renderer loads at run time via
`asset_path("shaders/flat.spv")`.

## Draw with it

The renderer picks a pipeline per material. The renderer's `Material` carries a `shader` path
(default `"shaders/mesh.spv"`), and `request_mesh_pipeline` builds and caches one PSO per
distinct `(shader, unlit)` key. Point a material at the new shader:

```rust
let mut flat = Material::default();
flat.shader = "shaders/flat.spv".to_string();   // the .spv you just compiled
// attach `flat` to the DrawItems for the meshes you want drawn with it
```

The PSO cache builds `flat.spv` on first use and reuses it after. Check the pipeline count
once a mesh draws with it:

```sh
sa render-stats       # "pipelines" increments when flat.spv's PSO is built
```

> [!NOTE]
> The renderer's `Material::shader` is selected in engine code, not over the CLI — there's no
> `sa set-shader`. To see your shader live: set the shader path where the draw list is built,
> or edit the engine's `mesh.slang` in place so every mesh redraws with your changes on the
> next pipeline run. See
