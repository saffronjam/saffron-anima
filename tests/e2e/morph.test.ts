// Morph targets end to end: import a cube with one blend shape ("bulge") + a weights clip,
// round-trip the weights over the control plane (a written 0..1 vector reads back identically),
// and prove the GPU deform actually moves geometry — playing the weight clip changes the
// rendered silhouette across frames. Closes Phase 4/6 against the running engine.
